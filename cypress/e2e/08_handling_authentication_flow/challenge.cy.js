// challenge #1: sign up a new user in the application, you can do that manually
// with that user, make sure to create at least one board
//
// fill this custom "login" command with your credentials and fill the tests
// with appropriate commands. run these tests to make sure they work as intended
// you can take notice of the time it takes to execute them. as a next step
// wrap the commands in the custom command in the cy.session() function.
// observe how the execution time changes
//
// ðŸ’¯ extra credit challenge: add two more tests to this file, but make them run against
// some other user (create a new one in your database). remember that your session
// needs a unique name for every email - you can use "email" as a unique identifier
